<span class="i0">Mist in the valley, weeping mist<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beset my homeward way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No gleam of rose or amethyst<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hallowed the parting day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shroud, a shroud of awful grey<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wrapped every woodland brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drooped in crumbling disarray<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The stealthy pathway overhung<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By silent tree and tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which floated in that mystery<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As&mdash;poised in waveless deeps&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Within my groping mind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stile swam out: a wilderness<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rolled round it, grey and blind.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A yard in front, a yard behind,<br /></span>

<h2>LUCIFER'S FEAST</h2>

<h3>(A EUROPEAN NIGHTMARE.)</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To celebrate the ascent of man, one gorgeous night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lucifer gave a feast.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Its world-bewildering light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Danced in Belshazzar's tomb, and the old kings dead and gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt their dust creep to jewels in crumbling Babylon.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Two nations were His guests&mdash;the top and flower of Time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fore-front of an age which now had learned to climb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slopes where Newton knelt, the heights that Shakespeare trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountains whence Beethoven rolled the voice of God.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lucifer's feasting-lamps were like the morning stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at the board-head shone the blood-red lamp of Mars.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">League upon glittering league, white front and flabby face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bent o'er the groaning board. Twelve brave men droned the grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with instinctive tact, in courtesy to their Host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Omitted God the Son and God the Holy Ghost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the God of Battles raised their humble prayers.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, then, like thunder, all the guests drew up their chairs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By each a drinking-cup, yellow, almost, as gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>The blue eye-sockets gave the thumbs a good firm hold</i>)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorned the flowery board. Could even brave men shrink?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why if the cups <i>were</i> skulls, they had red wine to drink!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had not each a napkin, white and peaked and proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting to wipe his mouth? A napkin? Nay, a shroud!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was a giant's feast, on hell's imperial scale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blades glistened.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">The shrouds&mdash;O, in one snowy gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pink hands fluttered them out, and spread them on their knees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knew what gouts might drop, what filthy flakes of grease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now that o'er every shoulder, through the coiling steam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inhuman faces peered, with wolfish eyes a-gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grey-faced vampire Lusts that whinneyed in each ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hints of the hideous courses?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">None may name them here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None? And we may not see! The distant cauldrons cloak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lava-coloured plains with clouds of umber smoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, by that shrapnel-light, by those wild shooting stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rip the clouds away with fiercer fire than Mars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are painted sharp as death. If these can eat and drink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chatter and laugh and rattle their knives, why should we shrink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From empty names? We know those ghastly gleams are true:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should Christ cry again&mdash;<i>They know not what they do?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They, heirs of all the ages, sons of Shakespeare's land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They, brothers of Beethoven, smiling, cultured, bland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whisper with sidling heads to ghouls with bloody lips.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Each takes upon his plate a small round thing that drips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quivers, a child's heart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">Miles on miles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glittering table bends o'er that first course, and smiles;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, through the wreaths of smoke, the grey Lusts bear aloft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second course, on leaden chargers, large and soft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bodies of women, steaming in an opal mist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red-branded here and there where vampire-teeth have kissed.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But white as pig's flesh, newly killed, and cleanly dressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lemon in each mouth and roses round each breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emblems to show how deeply, sweetly satisfied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breasts, the lips, can sleep, whose children fought and died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For&mdash;what? For country? God, once more Thy shrapnel-light!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let those dark slaughter-houses burst upon our sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These kitchens are too clean, too near the tiring room!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Thy white shrapnel rend those filthier veils of gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rip the last fogs away and strip the foul thing bare!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One lightning-picture&mdash;see&mdash;yon bayonet-bristling square<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mown down, mown down, mown down, wild swathes of crimson wheat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white-eyed charge, the blast, the terrible retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood-greased wheels of cannon thundering into line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er that red writhe of pain, rent groin and shattered spine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moaning faceless face that kissed its child last night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The raw pulp of the heart that beat for love's delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heap of twisting bodies, clotted and congealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one red huddle of anguish on the loathsome field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seas of obscene slaughter spewing their blood-red yeast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Multitudes pouring out their entrails for the feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing not why, but dying, they think, for some high cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dying for "hearth and home," their flags, their creeds, their laws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask of the Bulls and Bears, ask if they understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How both great grappling armies bleed for their own land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in that faith they die! These hoodwinked thousands die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Simply as heroes, gulled by hell's profoundest lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who keeps the slaughter-house? Not these, not these who gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought but the sergeant's shilling and the homeless pain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who pulls the ropes? Not these, who buy their crust of bread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the salt sweat of labour! These but bury their dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sweat again for food!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">Christ, is the hour not come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To send forth one great voice and strike this dark hell dumb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A voice to out-crash the cannon, one united cry<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Myself unto Myself am Throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Myself unto Myself am Thrall<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Or with his foot-rule metes, the skies;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Or tunnels through the rocks, and then&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn to Me as he falls asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, in his dreams, feel for My hand again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<h2>MOUNT IDA</h2>

<p>[This poem commemorates an event of some years ago, when a young
Englishman&mdash;still remembered by many of his contemporaries at
Oxford&mdash;went up into Mount Ida and was never seen again.]</p>

<h2>TALES OF THE MERMAID TAVERN</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Knight of the Ocean-sea</span></h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Under that foggy sunset London glowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one huge cob-webbed flagon of old wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as I walked down Fleet Street, the soft sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mowed thro' the roaring thoroughfares, transfused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hard sharp outlines, blurred the throngs of black<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On either pavement, blurred the rolling stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of red and yellow busses, till the town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned to a golden suburb of the clouds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, round that mighty bubble of St. Paul's,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the up-turned faces of the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An air-ship slowly sailed, with whirring fans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A voyager in the new-found realms of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shadowy silken chrysalis whence should break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What radiant wings in centuries to be.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, wandering on, while all the shores of Time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softened into Eternity, it seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dead man touched me with his living hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A flaming legend passed me in the streets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of London&mdash;laugh who will&mdash;that City of Clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where what a dreamer yet, in spite of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is man, that splendid visionary child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sent his fairy beacon through the dusk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a blue bus before the moon was risen,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>This Night, at eight, The Tempest!</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">Dreaming thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Small wonder that my footsteps went astray!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found myself within a narrow street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone. There was no rumour, near or far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the long tides of traffic. In my doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turned and knocked upon an old inn-door,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard by, an ancient inn of mullioned panes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crazy beams and over-hanging eaves:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as I knocked, the slowly changing west<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to change all the world with it and leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only that old inn steadfast and unchanged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rock in the rich-coloured tides of time.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, suddenly, as a song that wholly escapes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembrance, at one note, wholly returns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, as I knocked, memory returned to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew it all&mdash;the little twisted street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rough wet cobbles gleaming, far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like opals, where it ended on the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, overhead, the darkly smiling face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that old wizard inn; I knew by rote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smooth sun-bubbles in the worn green paint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the doors and shutters.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">There was one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself had idly scratched away one dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One mad May-dawn, three hundred years ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When out of the woods we came with hawthorn boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found the doors locked, as they seemed to-night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three hundred years ago&mdash;nay, Time was dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No need to scan the sign-board any more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where that white-breasted siren of the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curled her moon-silvered tail among such rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As never in the merriest seaman's tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke the blue-bliss of fabulous lagoons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the Spanish Main.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">And, through the dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as I stood and listened, came a sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of clashing wine-cups: then a deep-voiced song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made the old timbers of the Mermaid Inn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shake as a galleon shakes in a gale of wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she rolls glorying through the Ocean-sea.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i8">Just where they took the sunset's kiss, I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i8">A figure like foot-feathered Mercury,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Tall, straight and splendid as a sunset-cloud.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Clad in a crimson doublet and trunk-hose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rapier at his side; and, as he paused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His long fantastic shadow swayed and swept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against my feet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">A moment he looked back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then swaggered down as if he owned a world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which had forgotten&mdash;did I wake or dream?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even his gracious ghost!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">Over his arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He swung a gorgeous murrey-coloured cloak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ciprus velvet, caked and smeared with mud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As on the day when&mdash;did I dream or wake?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had not all this happened once before?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he had laid that cloak before the feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Gloriana! By that mud-stained cloak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas he! Our Ocean-Shepherd! Walter Raleigh!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He brushed me passing, and with one vigorous thrust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opened the door and entered. At his heels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I followed&mdash;into the Mermaid!&mdash;through three yards<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pitch-black gloom, then into an old inn-parlour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swimming with faces in a mist of smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That up-curled, blue, from long Winchester pipes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While&mdash;like some rare old picture, in a dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recalled&mdash;quietly listening, laughing, watching,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale on that old black oaken wainscot floated<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One bearded oval face, young, with deep eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Raleigh hailed as "Will!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i32">But as I stared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sudden buffet from a brawny hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made all my senses swim, and the room rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With laughter as upon the rush-strewn floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My feet slipped and I fell. Then a gruff voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Growled over me&mdash;"Get up now, John-a-dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else mine host must find another drawer!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou not heard us calling all this while?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as I scrambled up, the rafters rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cries of "Sack! Bring me a cup of sack!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Canary! Sack! Malmsey! and Muscadel!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I understood and flew. I was awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A leather-jerkined pot-boy to these gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prentice Ganymede to the Mermaid Inn!</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There, flitting to and fro with cups of wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard them toss the Chrysomelan names<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From mouth to mouth&mdash;Lyly and Peele and Lodge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kit Marlowe, Michael Drayton, and the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Ben, rare Ben, brick-layer Ben, who rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a great galleon on his ingle-bench.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some twenty years of age he seemed; and yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This young Gargantua with the bull-dog jaws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The T, for Tyburn, branded on his thumb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grim pock-pitted face, was growling tales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Dekker that would fright a buccaneer.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How in the fierce Low Countries he had killed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His man, and won that scar on his bronzed fist;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was taken prisoner, and turned Catholick;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, now returned to London, was resolved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To blast away the vapours of the town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Boreas-throated plays of thunderous mirth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'll thwack their Tribulation-Wholesomes, lad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their Yellow-faced Envies and lean Thorns-i'-the-Flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the <i>Black-friars Theatre</i>, or <i>The Rose</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else <i>The Curtain</i>. Failing these, I'll find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some good square inn-yard with wide galleries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And windows level with the stage. 'Twill serve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Comedy of Vapours; though, I grant.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Tragedy a private House is best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, just as Burbage tip-toes to a deed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blood, or, over your stable's black half-door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marked <i>Battlements</i> in white chalk, your breathless David<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glowers at the whiter Bathsheba within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some humorous coach-horse neighs a 'hallelujah'!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pit splits its doublets. Over goes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole damned apple-barrel, and the yard<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of prentices, green madams, and cut-purses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For half-chewed Norfolk pippins. Never mind!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Printed last week? A bouncing boy, my lad!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he's at work on a Midsummer's Dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That turns the world to fairyland!"</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i36">All these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many more were there, and all were young!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, as I brimmed their cups, I heard the voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Raleigh ringing across the smoke-wreathed room,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ben, could you put a frigate on the stage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've found a tragedy for you. Have you heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The true tale of Sir Humphrey Gilbert?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i40">"No!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why, Ben, of all the tragical affairs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Ocean-sea, and of that other Ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all men sail so blindly, and misjudge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their friends, their charts, their storms, their stars, their God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there be truth in the blind crowder's song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bought in Bread Street for a penny, this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the brief type and chronicle of them all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listen!" Then Raleigh sent these rugged rhymes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some blind crowder rolling in great waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of passion across the gloom. At each refrain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sank his voice to a broad deep undertone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the distant roar of breaking surf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the low thunder of eternal tides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled up the pauses of the nearer storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Storm against storm, a soul against the sea:&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sir Humphrey Gilbert, hard of hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Knight-in-chief of the Ocean-sea,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A morrice round the Mermaid Inn to-night."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, sir, the damned are damned!"<br /></span>
<span class="i36">"Come, sit you down!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take some more wine! You'd have them all be damned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except Dick Cholmeley. What must I unsay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save him?" A quick eyelid dropt at Ben.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Now tell me, Master Bame!"<br /></span>
<span class="i28">"Sir, he derides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The books of Moses!"<br /></span>
<span class="i26">"Bame, do you believe?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's none to hear us but Be&euml;lzebub&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you believe that we must taste of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because God set a foolish naked wench<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too near an apple-tree, how long ago?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five thousand years? But there were men on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long before that!" "Nay, nay, sir, if you read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The books of Moses...." "Moses was a juggler!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A juggler, sir, how, what!" "Nay, sir, be calm!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take some more wine&mdash;the white, if that's too red!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never cared for Moses! Help yourself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To red-deer pie. Good!<br /></span>
<span class="i28">All the miracles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You say that he performed&mdash;why, what are they?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know one Heriots, lives in Friday Street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can do much more than Moses! Eat your pie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In patience, friend, the mouth of man performs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One good work at a time. What says he, Ben?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O&mdash;<i>led them through the wilderness</i>! No doubt<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The journey in six months. Believe me, sir,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is no miracle. Moses gulled the Jews!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skilled in the sly tricks of the Egyptians,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only one art betrayed him. Sir, his books<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are filthily written. I would undertake&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I were put to write a new religion&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A method far more admirable. Eh, what?<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Gruel in the vestibule?</i> Interpret, Ben!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mouth's too full! <i>O, the New Testament!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, there, consider, were not all the Apostles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fishermen and base fellows, without wit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or worth?"&mdash;again his eyelid dropt at Ben.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The Apostle Paul alone had wit, and he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was a most timorous fellow in bidding us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prostrate ourselves to worldly magistrates<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I fear no bugbears or hobgoblins, sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would have all men not to be afraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of roasting, toasting, pitch-forks, or the threats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of earthly ministers, tho' their mouths be stuffed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One thing I will confess&mdash;if I must choose&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A hen-coop round his waist, nicked in the night<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He stood behind him in the gloom and smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the table at Ben, whose eyes still blazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With boyhood's generous wrath. "Rob was a poet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had I known ... no matter! I am sorry</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought I wronged him. His heart's blood beats in this.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look, where he says he dies forsaken, Kit!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Died drunk, more like," growled Ben. "And if he did,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will answered, "none was there to help him home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had not a poor old cobbler chanced upon him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dying in the streets, and taken him to his house,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Read his last words. You know he left his wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And played the moth at tavern tapers, burnt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wings and dropt into the mud. Read here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His dying words to his forsaken wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Written in blood, Ben, blood. Read it, '<i>I charge thee,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus on their poor dead youth, this withered shadow<br /></span>

<span class="i0">See&mdash;in its face he prays her not to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father's, but her own. '<i>He is yet green</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And may grow straight</i>,' so flickers his last jest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then out for ever. At the last he begged<br /></span>

<span class="i30">"No&mdash;not to-night,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kit whispered, laughing, "I've a prettier plan<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It was a surfeit killed him, Rhenish wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pickled herrings. His shirt was very foul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had but one. His doublet, too, was frayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his boots broken ..."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">"What! Gonzago, you!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A short fat player called in a deep voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the room and, throwing aside his cloak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To show the woman's robe he wore beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minced up to Bame and bellowed&mdash;"'Tis such men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As you that tempt us women to our fall!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the throng of players rocked and roared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at a nod and wink from Kit a hush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held them again.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">"Look to the door," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Is any listening?" The young player crept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mask of mystery, to the door and peeped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"All's well! The coast is clear!"<br /></span>
<span class="i34">"Then shall we tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our plan to Master Bame?"<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Round the hushed room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went Kit, a pen and paper in his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whispering each to read, digest, and sign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Ben re-filled the glass of Master Bame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And now," said Kit aloud, "what think you, lads?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall he be told?" Solemnly one or two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Gan shake their heads with "Safety! safety! Kit!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O, Bame can keep a secret! Come, we'll tell him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He can advise us how a righteous man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should act! We'll let him share an he approve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, Master Bame,&mdash;come closer&mdash;my good friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ben Jonson here, hath lately found a way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of&mdash;hush! Come closer!&mdash;coining money, Bame."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Coining!" "Ay, hush, now! Hearken! A certain sure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And indiscoverable method, sir!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is acquainted with one Poole, a felon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lately released from Newgate, hath great skill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mixture of metals&mdash;hush!&mdash;and, by the help<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a right cunning maker of stamps, we mean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To coin French crowns, rose-nobles, pistolettes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Angels and English shillings."<br /></span>
<span class="i30">For one breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bame stared at him with bulging beetle-eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then murmured shyly as a country maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her first wooing, "Is't not against the law?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why, sir, who makes the law? Why should not Bame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coin his own crowns like Queen Elizabeth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is but mortal! And consider, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good works it should prosper in your hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without regard to red-deer pies and wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White as the Milky Way. Such secrets, Bame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were not good for the general; but a few<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discreet and righteous palms, your own, my friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mine,&mdash;what think you?"</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i28">With a hesitant glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of well-nigh child-like cunning, screwing his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bame laughed a little huskily and looked round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At that grave ring of anxious faces, all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding their breath and thrilling his blunt nerves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their stage-practice. "And no risk?" breathed Bame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No risk at all?" "O, sir, no risk at all!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We make the very coins. Besides, that part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touches not you. Yours is the honest face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's all we want."<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Why, sir, if you be sure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no risk ..."<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"You'll help to spend it. Good!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll talk anon of this, and you shall carry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More angels in your pocket, master Bame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than e'er you'll meet in heaven. Set hand on seal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this now, master Bame, to prove your faith.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, all have signed it. Here's the quill, dip, write.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good!"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">And Kit, pocketing the paper, bowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gull to the inn-door, saying as he went,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You shall hear further when the plan's complete.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there's one great condition&mdash;not one word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One breath of scandal more on Robert Greene.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's dead; but he was one of us. The day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You air his shirt, I air this paper, too."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No gleam of understanding, even then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Illumed that long white face: no stage, indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has known such acting as the Mermaid Inn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That night, and Bame but sniggered, "Why, of course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's good in all men; and the best of us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will make mistakes."<br /></span>
<span class="i20">"But no mistakes in this,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Kit, "or all together we shall swing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Tyburn&mdash;who knows what may leap to light?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You understand? No scandal!" "Not a breath!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, in dead silence, Master Richard Bame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went out into the darkness and the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ask, as I have heard, for many a moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The price of malmsey-butts and silken hose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doublets slashed with satin.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i34">As the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slammed on his back, the pent-up laughter burst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With echo and re-echo round the room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ceased as Will tossed on the glowing hearth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last poor Testament of Robert Greene.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All watched it burn. The black wind wailed and moaned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the Mermaid as the sparks flew up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"God, what a night for ships upon the sea,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Raleigh, peering through the wet black panes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well&mdash;we may thank Him for the Little Red Ring!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>The Little Red Ring</i>," cried Kit, "<i>the Little Red Ring!</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then up stood Dekker on the old black settle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Give it a thumping chorus, lads," he called,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sang this brave song of the Mermaid Inn:&mdash;<br /></span>

<h4>BLACK BILL'S HONEY-MOON</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The garlands of a Whitsun ale were strewn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About our rushes, the night that Raleigh brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bacon to sup with us. There, on that night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the singer of the <i>Fa&euml;rie Queen</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quietly spreading out his latest cantos<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Shakespeare's eye, like white sheets in the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marlowe, our morning-star, and Michael Drayton<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talked in that ingle-nook. And Ben was there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humming a song upon that old black settle:<br /></span>
<span class="i9">"Or leave a kiss but in the cup<br /></span>
<span class="i9">And I'll not ask for wine."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, meanwhile, he drank malmsey.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Francis Bacon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straddled before the fire; and, all at once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said to Shakespeare, in a voice that gripped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Mermaid Tavern like an arctic frost:</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>There are no poets in this age of ours,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Not to compare with Plautus. They are all</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dead, the men that were famous in old days.</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why&mdash;so they are," said Will. The humming stopped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw poor Spenser, a shy gentle soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With haunted eyes like starlit forest pools,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smuggling his cantos under his cloak again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"There's verse enough, no doubt," Bacon went on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But English is no language for the Muse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom would you call our best? There's Gabriel Harvey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Edward, Earl of Oxford. Then there's Dyer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Doctor Golding; while, for tragedy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thomas, Lord Buckhurst, hath a lofty vein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in a lighter prettier vein, why, Will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is <i>thyself!</i> But&mdash;where's Euripides?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dead," echoed Ben, in a deep ghost-like voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drip&mdash;drip&mdash;drip&mdash;outside we heard the rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Miserably dropping round the Mermaid Inn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy Summer's Night&mdash;eh, Will? Midsummer's Night?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's a quaint fancy," Bacon droned anew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But&mdash;Athens was an error, Will! Not Athens!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Titania knew not Athens! Those wild elves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy Midsummer's Dream&mdash;eh? Midnight's Dream?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are English all. Thy woods, too, smack of England;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They never grew round Athens. Bottom, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is not Greek!"<br /></span>
<span class="i16">"Greek?" Will said, with a chuckle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Bottom a Greek? Why, no, he was the son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Marian Hacket, the fat wife that kept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ale-house, Wincot-way. I lodged with her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walking from Stratford. You have never tramped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along that countryside? By Burton Heath?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, well, you would not know my fairylands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It warms my blood to let my home-spuns play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around your cold white Athens. There's a joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In jumping time and space."<br /></span>
<span class="i32">But, as he took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cup of sack I proffered, solemnly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lawyer shook his head. "Will, couldst thou use</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy talents with discretion, and obey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Classic examples, those mightst match old Plautus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all except priority of the tongue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This English tongue is only for an age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Latin for all time. So I propose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To embalm in Latin my philosophies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well seize your hour! But, ere you die, you'll sail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A British galleon to the golden courts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cleopatra."<br /></span>
<span class="i18">"Sail it!" Marlowe roared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mimicking in a fit of thunderous glee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drums and trumpets of his Tamburlaine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And let her buccaneers bestride the sphinx,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And play at bowls with Pharaoh's pyramids,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hale white Egypt with their tarry hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home to the Mermaid! Lift the good old song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Rob Greene loved. Gods, how the lad would shout it!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand up and sing, John Davis!"<br /></span>
<span class="i34">"Up!" called Raleigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lift the chanty of Black Bill's Honey-moon, Jack!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll keep the chorus going!"<br /></span>
<span class="i32">"Silence, all!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ben Jonson echoed, rolling on his bench:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This gentle lawyer hath a longing, lads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear a right Homeric hymn. Now, Jack!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wet your whistle, first! A cup of sack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the first canto! Muscadel, the next!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Canary for the last!" I brought the cup.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John Davis emptied it at one mighty draught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leapt on a table, stamped with either foot,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">But, over all the hubbub, rose the drone<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Of Francis Bacon,&mdash;"Now, this Muscovy<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Is a cold clime, not favourable to bees<br /></span>
<span class="i6">(Or love, which is a weakness of the south)<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Gender hot fruits and odoriferous spice,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In this case we may think that honey and flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Are comparable with the light airs of May<br /></span>

<span class="i6">As Pliny saith, this honey being a swette<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Of heaven, a certain spettle of the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Which, gathering unclean vapours as it falls,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Hangs as a fat dew on the boughs, the bees<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Obtain it partly thus, and afterwards<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Corrupt it in their stomachs, and at last<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Expel it through their mouths and harvest it<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In hives; yet, of its heavenly source it keeps<br /></span>
<span class="i6">A great part. Thus, by various principles<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Of natural philosophy we observe&mdash;"<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And, as he leaned to Drayton, droning thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">I saw a light gleam of celestial mirth<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Flit o'er the face of Shakespeare&mdash;scarce a smile&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">A swift irradiation from within<br /></span>
<span class="i6">As of a cloud that softly veils the sun.<br /></span>

<h4>THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We had just set our brazier smouldering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep the Plague away. Many a house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was marked with the red cross. The bells tolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Incessantly. Nash crept into the room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shivering like a fragment of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face yellow as parchment, and his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"The Plague! He has taken it!" voices cried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That's not the Plague! The old carrion-crow is drunk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But stand away. What ails you, Nash my lad?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, through the clamour, as through a storm at sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The master's voice, the voice of Ben, rang out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nash!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Ben leapt to his feet, and like a ship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouldering the waves, he shouldered the throng aside.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What ails you, man? What's that upon your breast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blood?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Marlowe is dead," said Nash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stunned the room to silence ...<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i36">"Marlowe&mdash;dead!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ben caught him by the shoulders. "Nash! Awake!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What do you mean? Marlowe? Kit Marlowe? Dead?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I supped with him&mdash;why&mdash;not three nights ago!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are drunk! You are dazed! There's blood upon your coat!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That's&mdash;where he died," said Nash, and suddenly sank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sidelong across a bench, bowing his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between his hands ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wept, I believe. Then, like a whip of steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lean black figure sprang erect again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Marlowe!" he cried, "Kit Marlowe, killed for a punk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A taffeta petticoat! Killed by an apple-squire!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drunk! I was drunk; but I am sober now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sober enough, by God! Poor Kit is dead."</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Mermaid Inn was thronged for many a night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With startled faces. Voices rose and fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I recall them, in a great vague dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curious, pitiful, angry, thrashing out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tragic truth. Then, all along the Cheape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ballad-mongers waved their sheets of rhyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Croaking: <i>Come buy! Come buy! The bloody death</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of Wormall, writ by Master Richard Bame!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Come buy! Come buy! The Atheist's Tragedy.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, even in Bread Street, at our very door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowder to his cracked old fiddle sang:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"<i>He was a poet of proud repute</i><br /></span>

<span class="i12"><i>Now begging by the way.</i>"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, out of the hubbub and the clash of tongues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bawdy tales and scraps of balladry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As out of chaos rose the slow round world)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, though for the Mermaid Inn alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emerged some tragic semblance of a soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some semblance of the rounded truth, a world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glimpsed only through great mists of blood and tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet smitten, here and there, with dreadful light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I believe, from heaven.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">Strangely enough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Though Ben forgot his pipe and Will's deep eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deepened and softened, when they spoke of Kit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many a month thereafter) it was Nash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That took the blow like steel into his heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nash, our "Piers Penniless," whom Rob Greene had called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Young Juvenal," the first satirist of our age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nash, of the biting tongue and subtle sneer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brooded upon it, till his grief became<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At all the lies of shallower hearts.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i36">One night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night he raised the mists from that wild world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He talked with Chapman in the Mermaid Inn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Marlowe's poem that was left half-sung,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">A loaded silence filled the room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with the imminent spirit of the dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listening. And long that picture haunted me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nash, like a lithe young Mephistopheles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaning between the silver candle-sticks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the oak table, with his keen white face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark smouldering eyes, and black, dishevelled hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chapman, with something of the steady strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That helms our ships, and something of the Greek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cool clear passion of Platonic thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind the fringe of his Olympian beard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And broad Homeric brows, confronting him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gravely.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">There was a burden of mystery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brooding on all that night; and, when at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chapman replied, I knew he felt it, too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curious pedantry of his wonted speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was charged with living undertones, like truths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too strange and too tremendous to be breathed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save thro' a mask. And though, in lines that flamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once with strange rivalry, Shakespeare himself defied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chapman, that spirit "by spirits taught to write<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above a mortal pitch," Will's nimbler sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was quick to breathings from beyond our world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could not hold them lightly.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i32">"Ah, then Kit,"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sealed in the magic pages of that music<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, laying strong hold on universal laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ranges beyond these mud-walls of the flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though dull wits fail to follow. It was this<br /></span>

<span class="i6"><i>The warning of his own.</i>"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Strange he should ask a hod-man like myself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crown that miracle of his April age,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Chapman, murmuring softly under breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Amorous Leander, beautiful and young</i> ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, Nash, had I been only charged to raise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of its grave in the green Hellespont<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The body of that boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make him sparkle and leap thro' the cold waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fold young Hero to his heart again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The task were scarce as hard.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">But ... stranger still,"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his next words, although I hardly knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that he meant, went tingling through my flesh&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Before you spoke, before I knew his wish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had begun to write!<br /></span>
<span class="i22">I knew and loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His work. Himself I hardly knew at all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet&mdash;I know him now! I have heard him now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, since he pledged me in so rare a cup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll lift and drink to him, though lightnings fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From envious gods to scourge me. I will lift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This cup in darkness to the soul that reigns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In light on Helicon. Who knows how near?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I have thought, sometimes, when I have tried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To work his will, the hand that moved my pen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was mine, and yet&mdash;not mine. The bodily mask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is mine, and sometimes, dull as clay, it sleeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With old Mus&aelig;us. Then strange flashes come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oracular glories, visionary gleams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mask moves, not of itself, and sings."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I know that thought," said Nash. "A mighty ship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lightning-shattered wreck, out in that night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen, has foundered thundering. We sit here</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snug on the shore, and feel the wash of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The widening circles running to our feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can such a soul go down to glut the sharks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without one ripple? Here comes one sprinkle of spray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listen!" And through that night, quick and intense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hushed for thunder, tingled once again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a thin wire, the crowder's distant tune:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"<i>Had he been prenticed to the trade</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>His father followed still,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>This exit he had never made,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>Nor played a part so ill.</i>"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here is another," said Nash, "I know not why;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But like a weed in the long wash, I too<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O, I can play the crowder, fiddle a song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a dead friend, with any the best of you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie and kick heels in the sun on a dead man's grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet&mdash;God knows&mdash;it is the best we can;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And better than the world's way, to forget."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So saying, like one that murmurs happy words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To torture his own grief, half in self-scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He breathed a scrap of balladry that raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mists a moment from that Paradise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That primal world of innocence, where Kit<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">Dance down, hop down, after them, run!"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then, like an unfledged linnet, out<br /></span>

<span class="i4">With a piping shout,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"O, look at them, look at them, look at them, Dad!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Priest and prioress, abbot and friar,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Went thundering down, and round it hell still roars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That were a tale to snap all fiddle-strings."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Tell me," said Chapman.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">"Ah, you wondered why,"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To couch at London, there's a conquering point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To carry in triumph through Persepolis!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tell you Kit was nothing but a child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When some rich patron of the <i>Golden Shoe</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld him riding into Samarcand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a broken chair, the which he said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was a white steed, splashed with the blood of kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When, on that patron's bounty, he did ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So far as Cambridge, he was a brave lad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untamed, adventurous, but still innocent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, innocent as the cobbler's little self!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He brought to London just a bundle and stick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A slender purse, an Ovid, a few scraps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of song, and all unshielded, all unarmed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A child's heart, packed with splendid hopes and dreams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I say a child's heart, Chapman, and that phrase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowns, not dis-crowns, his manhood.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i32">Well&mdash;he turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An honest penny, taking some small part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In plays at the <i>Red Bull</i>. And, all the while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the paint and tinsel of the stage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the greasy cock-pit with its reek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of orange-peel and civet, as all of these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were but the clay churned by the glorious rush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his white chariots and his burning steeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, as the clay were a shadow, his great dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like bannered legions on some proud crusade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Empurpling all the deserts of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept on in triumph to the glittering towers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his abiding City.<br /></span>
<span class="i20">Then&mdash;he met<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That damned blood-sucking cockatrice, the pug<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some fine strutting mummer, one of those plagues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bred by our stage, a puff-ball on the hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Helicon. As for his wench&mdash;she too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had played so many parts that she forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cue for truth. King Puff had taught her well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was the vainer and more foolish thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She the more poisonous.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">One dark day, to spite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Archer, her latest paramour, a friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And apple-squire to Puff, she set her eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Marlowe ... feigned a joy in his young art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmured his songs, used all her London tricks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To coney-catch the country greenhorn. Man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kit never even <i>saw</i> her painted face!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He pored on books by candle-light and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Everything thro' a mist. O, I could laugh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think of it, only&mdash;his up-turned skull<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, in the dark, now that the flesh drops off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has laughed enough, a horrible silent laugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think his Angel of Light was, after all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the red-lipped Angel of the Plague.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was no better than the rest of us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No worse. He felt the heat. He felt the cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took her down to Deptford to escape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contagion, and the crashing of sextons' spades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On dead men's bones in every churchyard round;</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jangling bell and the cry, <i>Bring out your dead</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there she told him of her luckless life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wedded, deserted, both against her will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A luckless Eve that never knew the snake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True and half-true she mixed in one wild lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then&mdash;she caught him by the hand and wept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No death-cart passed to warn him with its bell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes, her perfumed hair, and her red mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her warm white breast, her civet-scented skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swimming before him, in a piteous mist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made the lad drunk, and&mdash;she was in his arms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that God had meant to wake one day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the Sun of Love, suddenly woke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By candle-light and cried, 'The Sun; The Sun!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he believed it, Chapman, he believed it!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a cobbler's son, and he believed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Love! Blind, through that mist, he caught at Love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The everlasting King of all this world.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kit was not clever. Clever men&mdash;like Pomp&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Makes his whole heart a sacrificial fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one whose love is in her supple skin,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At Deptford. Ay, Piers Penniless was there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soaked and besotted as I was, I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Everything. On her poop the minstrels played,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round her sea-worn keel, like meadow-sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curtseying round a lightning-blackened oak,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prentices and their sweethearts, heel and toe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Danced the brave English dances, clean and fresh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As May.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">But in her broad gun-guarded waist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once red with British blood, long tables groaned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For revellers not so worthy. Where her guns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had raked the seas, barrels of ale were sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bestrid by roaring tipplers. Where at night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The storm-beat crew silently bowed their heads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Drake before the King of Life and Death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A strumpet wrestled with a mountebank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pence, a loose-limbed Lais with a clown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cherry Hilton. Leering at their lewd twists,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cross-legged upon the deck, sluggish with sack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a squat toad sat Puff ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propped up against the bulwarks, at his side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Archer, his apple-squire, hiccoughed a bawdy song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly, through that orgy, with wild eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet with her customary smile, O, there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw in daylight what Kit Marlowe saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through blinding mists, the face of his first love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stood before her paramour on the deck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cocking her painted head to right and left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her white teeth smiling, but her voice a hiss:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Quickly,' she said to Archer, 'come away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or there'll be blood spilt!'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">'Better blood than wine,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Archer, struggling to his feet, 'but who,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who would spill blood?'<br /></span>
<span class="i24">'Marlowe!' she said.<br /></span>
<span class="i44">Then Puff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reeled to his feet. 'What, Kit, the cobbler's son?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lad that broke his leg at the <i>Red Bull</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tamburlaine-Marlowe, he that would chain kings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To's chariot-wheel? What, is he rushing hither?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would spill blood for Gloriana, hey?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, my Belph&oelig;be, you will crack my sides!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was this the wench that shipped a thousand squires?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, ho! But here he comes. Now, solemnly, lads,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Now walk the angels on the walls of heaven</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To entertain divine Zenocrate!</i>'</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there stood Kit, high on the storm-scarred poop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the sky, bare-headed. I saw his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale, innocent, just the dear face of that boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who walked to Cambridge with a bundle and stick,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little cobbler's son. Yet&mdash;there I caught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My only glimpse of how the sun-god looked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only for one moment.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">When he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mistress, his face whitened, and he shook.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the deck he came, a poor weak man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet&mdash;by God&mdash;the only man that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all our drunken crew.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">'Come along, Kit,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried Puff, 'we'll all be friends now, all take hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dance&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;the shaking of the sheets!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Archer, shuffling a step, raised his cracked voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Kit's own song to a falsetto tune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snapping one hand, thus, over his head as he danced:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">'<i>Come, live with me, and be my love,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i10"><i>And we will all the pleasures prove!</i>' ...<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Puff reeled between, laughing. 'Damn you,' cried Kit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, catching the fat swine by his round soft throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurled him headlong, crashing across the tables,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lie and groan in the red bilge of wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That washed the scuppers.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Kit gave him not one glance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Archer,' he said in a whisper.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Instantly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long thin rapier flashed in Archer's hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ship was one wild uproar. Women screamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And huddled together. A drunken clamorous ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seethed around Marlowe and his enemy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kit drew his dagger, slowly, and I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blood would be spilt.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">'Here, take my rapier, Kit!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cried across the crowd, seeing the lad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was armed so slightly. But he did not hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not reach him.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i24">All at once he leapt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a wounded tiger, past the rapier point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight at his enemy's throat. I saw his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up-raised to strike! I heard a harlot's scream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in mid-air, the hand stayed, quivering, white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A frozen menace.<br /></span>
<span class="i18">I saw a yellow claw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twisting the dagger out of that frozen hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw his own steel in that yellow grip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own lost lightning raised to strike at him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw it flash! I heard the driving grunt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him that struck! Then, with a shout, the crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sundered, and through the gap, a blank red thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streaming with blood came the blind face of Kit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reeling, to me! And I, poor drunken I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held my arms wide for him. Here, on my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one great sob, he burst his heart and died."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Nash ceased. And, far away down Friday Street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowder with his fiddler wailed again:<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah, you have said it," said Nash, "and there you know<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But where he fell, he fell. Before his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had learned to quell them, he was dashed to the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis yours to show that good men honoured him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, mark this, Chapman, since Kit Marlowe fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There will be fools that, in the name of Art,<br /></span>

<h4>THE COMPANION OF A MILE</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Thwack</span>! <i>Thwack</i>! One early dawn upon our door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard the bladder of some motley fool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bouncing, and all the dusk of London shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bells! I leapt from bed,&mdash;had I forgotten?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I flung my casement wide and craned my neck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the painted Mermaid. There he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His right leg yellow and his left leg blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With jingling cap, a sheep-bell at his tail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wielding his eel-skin bladder,&mdash;<i>bang! thwack! bang!</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catching a comrade's head with the recoil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And skipping away! All Bread Street dimly burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a reflected sky, green, red and white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With littered branches, ferns and hawthorn-clouds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, round Sir Fool, a frolic morrice-troop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of players, poets, prentices, mad-cap queans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robins and Marians, coloured like the dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sparkling like the greenwood whence they came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their fresh boughs all dewy from the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clamoured, <i>Come down! Come down, and let us in!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">High over these, I suddenly saw Sir Fool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leap to a sign-board, swing to a conduit-head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And perch there, gorgeous on the morning sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tossing his crimson cockscomb to the blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crowing like Chanticleer, <i>Give them a rouse!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tickle it, tabourer! Nimbly, lasses, nimbly!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tuck up your russet petticoats and dance!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Let the Cheape know it is the first of May!</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as I seized shirt, doublet and trunk-hose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the hobby-horse come cantering down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pasteboard steed, dappled a rosy white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like peach-bloom, bridled with purple, bitted with gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crimson foot-cloth on his royal flanks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, riding him, His Majesty of the May!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round him the whole crowd frolicked with a shout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as I stumbled down the crooked stair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard them break into a dance and sing:&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My nightingales, my scraps of Lincoln green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hear my sermon!" On a window-seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stood, against the diamonded rich panes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the old oak parlour and, throwing back his hood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who should it be but Ben, rare Ben himself?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild troup laughed around him, some a-sprawl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On tables, kicking parti-coloured heels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some with their Marians jigging on their knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in the front of all, the motley fool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cross-legged upon the rushes.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">O, I knew him,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will Kemp, the player, who danced from London town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Norwich in nine days and was proclaimed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freeman of Marchaunt Venturers and hedge-king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of English morrice-dancery for ever!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His nine-days' wonder, through the countryside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was hawked by every ballad-monger. Kemp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raged at their shake-rag Muses. None but I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guessed ever for what reason, since he chose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His anticks for himself and, in his games,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was more than most May-fools fantastical.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I watched his thin face, as he rocked and crooned,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaking the squirrels' tails around his ears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, out of all the players I had seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face was quickest through its clay to flash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The passing mood. Though not a muscle stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very skin of it seemed to flicker and gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With little summer lightnings of the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At every fleeting fancy. For a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So quick to bleed at a pin-prick or to leap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughing through hell to save a butterfly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This world was difficult; and perchance he found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his fantastic games that open road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which even Will Shakespeare only found at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In motley and with some wild straws in his hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But "Drawer! drawer!" bellowed Friar Ben,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Make ready a righteous breakfast while I preach;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tankards of nut-brown ale, and cold roast beef,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cracknels, old cheese, flaunes, tarts and clotted cream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath any a wish not circumscribed by these?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A white-pot custard, for my white-pot queen,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried Kemp, waving his bauble, "mark this, boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A white-pot custard for my queen of May,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is not here, but that concerns not thee!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A white-pot Mermaid custard, with a crust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lashings of cream, eggs, apple-pulse and spice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little sugar and manchet bread. Away!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be swift!"<br /></span>
<span class="i16">And as I bustled to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Friar raised his big brown fists again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And preached in mockery of the Puritans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thought to strip the moonshine wings from Mab,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tear down the May-poles, rout our English games,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drive all beauty back into the sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then laughter and chatter and clashing tankards drowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All but their May-day jollity a-while.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, as their breakfast ended, and I sank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gasping upon a bench, there came still more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poets and players crowding into the room;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one&mdash;I only knew him as Sir John</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waved a great ballad at Will Kemp and laughed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Atonement, Will, atonement!"<br /></span>
<span class="i24">"What," groaned Kemp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Another penny poet? How many lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does <i>this</i> rogue tell? Sir, I have suffered much<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From these Melpomenes and strawberry quills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think them better at their bloody lines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On <i>The Blue Lady</i>. Sir, they set to work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At seven o'clock in the morning, the same hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I, myself, that's <i>Cavaliero</i> Kemp,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Frolickly footing, from the great Lord Mayor<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of Norwich."<br /></span>
<span class="i16">"Nay, Kemp, this is a May-day tune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A morrice of country rhymes, made by a poet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thought it shame so worthy an act as thine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should wither in oblivion if the Muse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her Castalian showers could keep it green.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while the fool nid-nodded all in time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir John, in swinging measure, trolled this tale:&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By Sudbury, by Sudbury, by little red-roofed Sudbury,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He wished to dance a mile with me! I made a courtly bow:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And "<i>Tickle your tabor, Tom</i>," I cried, "<i>we're going to market now</i>."</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And rollicking down the lanes we dashed, and frolicking up the hills we clashed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And like a sail behind me flapped his great white frock a-while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, with a gasp, he sank and swore that he could dance with me no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And&mdash;over the hedge a milk-maid laughed, <i>Not dance with him a mile</i>?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You lout!" she laughed, "I'll leave my pail, and dance with him for cakes and ale!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll dance a mile for love," she laughed, "and win my wager, too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your feet are shod and mine are bare; but when could leather dance on air?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A milk-maid's feet can fall as fair and light as falling dew."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I fitted her with morrice-bells, with treble, bass and tenor bells:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fore-bells, as I linked them at her throat, how soft they sang!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green linnets in a golden nest, they chirped and trembled on her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, faint as elfin blue-bells, at her nut-brown ankles rang.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I fitted her with morrice-bells that sweetened into woodbine bells,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And trembled as I hung them there and crowned her sunny brow:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And "<i>Tickle your tabor, Tom</i>," I cried, "<i>we're going to Sherwood now</i>!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When cocks were crowing, and light was growing, and horns were blowing, and milk-pails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">flowing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We swam thro' waves of emerald gloom along a chestnut aisle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, up a shining hawthorn-lane, we sailed into the sun again,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will Kemp and his companion, his companion of a mile.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Truer than most," snarled Kemp, "but mostly lies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why does he forget the miry lanes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Brainford with thick woods on either side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the deep holes, where I could find no ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But skipped up to my waist?" A crackling laugh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke from his lips which, if he had not worn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cap and bells, would scarce have roused the mirth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of good Sir John, who roundly echoed it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then waved his hand and said, "Nay, but he treats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your morrice in the spirit of Lucian, Will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thought that dancing was no mushroom growth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sprung from the beginning of the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Love persuaded earth, air, water, fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the jarring elements to move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In measure. Right to the heart of it, my lad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song goes, though the skin mislike you so."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, an there's more of it, I'll sing it, too!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis a fine tale, Sir John, I have it by heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although 'tis lies throughout." Up leapt Will Kemp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crouched and swayed, and swung his bauble round,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That rosy silken smile of his conceals<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And silken manners hide the nimblest wit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever trimmed a sail to catch the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of courtly favour. Mark my words now, Ben,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That youth will sail right up against the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By skilful tacking. But you run it fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Selden, you run it fine. Take my advice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And don't be too ironical, my boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or even the King will see it."<br /></span>
<span class="i32">He chuckled again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But tell them of your tractate!"<br /></span>
<span class="i34">"Here it is,"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then, with his round cherubic face aglow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lit his long silver pipe,<br /></span>
<span class="i26">"Why, first," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Camden being Clarencieux King-at-arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He read the King this little tract I wrote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against tobacco." And the Mermaid roared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With laughter. "Well, you went the way to hang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All three of them," cried Lyly, "and, as for Ben,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Trinidado goes to bed with him."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Green gosling, quack no more," Selden replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiling that rosy silken smile anew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The King's a <i>critic</i>! When have critics known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poet from his creatures, God from me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many cite Polonius to their sons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call it Shakespeare? Well, I took my text<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From sundry creatures of our great big Ben,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called it 'Jonson.'<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Camden read it out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without the flicker of an eye. His beard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saved us, I think. The King admired his text.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'<i>There is a man</i>,' he read, '<i>lies at death's door</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Thro' taking of tobacco. Yesterday</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He voided a bushel of soot</i>.'</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i30">'God bless my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bushel of soot! Think of it!' said the King.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The man who wrote those great and splendid words,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Camden replied,&mdash;I had prepared his case<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carefully&mdash;'lies in Newgate prison, sire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His nose and ears await the hangman's knife.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ah,' said the shrewd King, goggling his great eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cannily. 'Did he not defame the Scots?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'That's true,' said Camden, like a man that hears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truth for the first time. 'O ay, he defamed 'em,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King said, very wisely, once again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ah, but,' says Camden, like a man that strives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With more than mortal wit, 'only such Scots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As flout your majesty, and take tobacco.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is a Scot, himself, and hath the gift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of preaching.' Then we gave him Jonson's lines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against Virginia. '<i>Neither do thou lust</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>After that tawny weed; for who can tell,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Before the gathering and the making up,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What alligarta may have spawned thereon,'</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or words to that effect.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">'Magneeficent!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spluttered the King&mdash;'who knows? Who knows, indeed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's a grand touch, that Alligarta, Camden!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The Scot who wrote those great and splendid words,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Camden, 'languishes in Newgate, sire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ears and nose&mdash;'<br /></span>
<span class="i22">And there, as we arranged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Inigo Jones, the ladies of the court<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assailed the King in tears. Their masque and ball<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would all be ruined. All their Grecian robes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Procured at vast expense, were wasted now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The masque was not half-written. Master Jones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had lost his poets. They were all in gaol.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their noses and their ears ...<br /></span>
<span class="i32">'God bless my soul,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spluttered the King, goggling his eyes again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What d'you make of it, Camden?'&mdash;</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i36">'I should say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Puritan plot, sire; for these justices&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who love tobacco&mdash;use their law, it seems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To flout your Majesty at every turn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If this continue, sire, there'll not be left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A loyal ear or nose in all your realm.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At that, our noble monarch well-nigh swooned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hunched his body, padded as it was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the assassin's knife, six inches deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With great green quilts, wagged his enormous head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, in a dozen words, he wooed destruction:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'It is presumption and a high contempt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In subjects to dispute what kings can do,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He whimpered. 'Even as it is blasphemy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thwart the will of God.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">He waved his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rose. 'These men must be released, at once!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as I think, to seek a safer place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He waddled from the room, his rickety legs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubling beneath that great green feather-bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He calls his 'person.'&mdash;I shall dream to-night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of spiders, Camden.&mdash;But in half an hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inigo Jones was armed with Right Divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save such ears and noses as the ball<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Required for its perfection. Think of that!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let this earthly ball remember, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Chapman, Marston, and our great big Ben<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Owe their poor adjuncts to&mdash;ten Grecian robes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"But Ben has narrowly escaped her love,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Chapman gravely.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"What do you mean?" said Lodge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as he spoke, there was a sudden hush.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tall gaunt woman with great burning eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And white hair blown back softly from a face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ethereally fierce, as might have looked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cassandra in old age, stood at the door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where is my Ben?" she said.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">"Mother!" cried Ben.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rose and caught her in his mighty arms.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her labour-reddened, long-boned hands entwined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind his neck.<br /></span>
<span class="i18">"She brought this to the gaol,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Chapman quietly, tossing a phial across<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Camden. "And he meant to take it, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the hangman touched him. Half an hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you'd have been too late to save big Ben.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has lived too much in ancient Rome to love<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That gaunt old body sobbing against his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dekker, to make her think they paid no heed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to sing; and very softly now.<br /></span>

<h4>THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas on an All Souls' Eve that our good Inn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Whereof, for ten years now, myself was host&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard and took part in its most eerie tale.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It was a bitter night, and master Ben,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;His hair now flecked with grey, though youth still fired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His deep and ageless eyes,&mdash;in the old oak-chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the roaring hearth, puffed at his pipe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little sad, as often I found him now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembering vanished faces. Yet the years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought others round him. Wreaths of Heliochrise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleamed still in that great tribe of Benjamin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burned still across the malmsey and muscadel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chapman and Browne, Herrick,&mdash;a name like thyme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crushed into sweetness by a bare-foot maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Milking, at dewy dawn, in Elfin-land,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These three came late, and sat in a little room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aside, supping together, on one great pie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof both crust and coffin were prepared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By master Herrick's receipt, and all washed down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mighty cups of sack. This left with Ben,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John Ford, wrapped in his cloak, brooding aloof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drayton and Lodge and Drummond of Hawthornden.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Suddenly, in the porch, I heard a sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of iron that grated on the flags. A spade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pick came edging through the door.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i40">"O, room!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Room for the master-craftsman," muttered Ford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grey old sexton Scarlet hobbled in.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He shuffled off the snow that clogged his boots,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;On my clean rushes!&mdash;brushed it from his cloak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Northern Russet, wiped his rheumatic knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blew out his lanthorn, hung it on a nail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaned his rude pick and spade against the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flung back his rough frieze hood, flapped his gaunt arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called for ale.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"Come to the fire," said Lodge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Room for the wisest counsellor of kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kindly sage that puts us all to bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tucks us up beneath the grass-green quilt."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Plenty of work, eh Timothy?" said Ben.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Work? Where's my liquor? O, ay, there's work to spare,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Scarlet croaked, then quaffed his creaming stoup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Ben said softly&mdash;"Pity you could not spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You and your Scythe-man, some of the golden lads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I have seen here in the Mermaid Inn!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, with a quiet smile he shook his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned to master Drummond of Hawthornden.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well, songs are good; but flesh and blood are better.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grey old tomb of Horace glows for me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the centuries, with one little fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lit by a girl's light hand." Then, under breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet with some passion, he murmured this brief rhyme:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">I<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Dulce ridentem</i>, laughing through the ages,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Dulce loquentem</i>, O, fairer far to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rarer than the wisdom of all his golden pages<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Floats the happy laughter of his vanished Lalage.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">II<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Dulce loquentem</i>,&mdash;we hear it and we know it.<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Dulce ridentem</i>,&mdash;so musical and low.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Mightier than marble is my song!" Ah, did the poet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Know why little Lalage was mightier even so?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">III<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Dulce ridentem</i>,&mdash;through all the years that sever,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Clear as o'er yon hawthorn hedge we heard her passing by,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lalagen amabo</i>,&mdash;a song may live for ever<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Dulce loquentem</i>,&mdash;but Lalage must die.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I'd like to learn that rhyme," the sexton said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I've a fine memory too. You start me now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd keep it up all night with ancient ballads."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then&mdash;a strange thing happened. I saw John Ford<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"With folded arms and melancholy hat"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As in our Mermaid jest he still would sit)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching old Scarlet like a man in trance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sexton gulped his ale and smacked his lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then croaked again&mdash;"O, ay, there's work to spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We fills 'em faster than the spades can dig,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, all at once, the lights burned low and blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ford leaned right forward, with his grim black eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Widening.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Why, that's a marvellous ring!" he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pointed to the sexton's gnarled old hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread on the black oak-table like the claw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some great bird of prey. "A ruby worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ransom of a queen!" The fire leapt up!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sexton stared at him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stretched his hand out, with its blue-black nails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full in the light, a grim earth-coloured hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But bare as it was born.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">"There was a ring!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could have sworn it! Red as blood!" cried Ford.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ben and Lodge and Drummond of Hawthornden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All stared at him. For such a silent soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was master Ford that, when he suddenly spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It struck the rest as dumb as if the Sphinx<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had opened its cold stone lips. He would sit mute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brooding, aloof, for hours, his cloak around him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A staff between his knees, as if prepared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a long journey, a lonely pilgrimage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To some dark tomb; a strange and sorrowful soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not&mdash;as many thought him&mdash;harsh or hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of a most kind patience. Though he wrote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In blood, they say, the blood came from his heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the sufferings of this world he took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his own soul, and bade them pasture there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till out of his compassion, he became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A monument of bitterness. He rebelled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so fell short of that celestial height</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereto the greatest only climb, who stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Shakespeare, and accept the Eternal Law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These find, in law, firm footing for the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strength that binds the stars, and reins the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The base of being, the pillars of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pledge of honour, the pure cord of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The form of truth, the golden floors of heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These men discern a height beyond all heights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A depth below all depths, and never an end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a pang beyond it, and a hope;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a heaven beyond it, and a hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For these, despair is like a bubble pricked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An old romance to make young lovers weep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For these, the law becomes a fiery road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Jacob's ladder through that vast abyss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lacking no rung from realm to loftier realm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wanting one degree from dust to wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, at the last, radiant with victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay their strong hands upon the wing&egrave;d steeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fiery chariots, and exult to hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves, the throbbing reins, whereby they steer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stormy splendours.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">He, being less, rebelled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried out for unreined steeds, and unruled stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An unprohibited ocean and a truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untrue; and the equal thunder of the law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurled him to night and chaos, who was born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shine upon the forehead of the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet&mdash;the voice of darkness and despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May speak for heaven where heaven would not be heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May fight for heaven where heaven would not prevail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the consummate splendour of that strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swallowing up all discords, all defeat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one huge victory, harmonising all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make Lucifer, at last, at one with God.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There,&mdash;on that All Souls' Eve, you might have thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dead man spoke, to see how Drayton stared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Drummond started.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"You saw no ruby ring,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old sexton muttered sullenly. "If you did,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The worse for me, by all accounts. The lights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burned low. You caught the firelight on my fist.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was it like, this ring?"<br /></span>
<span class="i30">"A band of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a great ruby, heart-shaped, fit to burn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the breasts of La&iuml;s. Am I awake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dreaming?"<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"Well,&mdash;that makes the second time!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's many have said they saw it, out of jest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To scare me. For the astrologer did say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third time I should die. Now, did you see it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most likely someone's told you that old tale!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You hadn't heard it, now?"<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Ford shook his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What tale?" said Ben.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"O, you could make a book<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About my life. I've talked with quick and dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And neither ghost nor flesh can fright me now!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish it was a ring, so's I could catch him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sell him; but I've never seen him yet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A white witch told me, if I did, I'd go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clink, just like that, to heaven or t'other place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whirled in a fiery chariot with ten steeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The way Elijah went. For I have seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many mighty things that I must die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mightily.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Well,&mdash;I came, sirs, to my craft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day mine uncle Robert dug the grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For good Queen Katharine, she whose heart was broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By old King Harry, a very great while ago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maybe you've heard about my uncle, sirs?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was far-famous for his grave-digging.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In depth, in speed, in neatness, he'd no match!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They've put a fine slab to his memory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Peterborough Cathedral&mdash;<i>Robert Scarlet,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sexton for half a century</i>, it says,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In Peterborough Cathedral, where he built</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The last sad habitation for two queens,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And many hundreds of the common sort.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And now himself, who for so many built</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Eternal habitations, others have buried.</i></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Obiit anno &aelig;tatis, ninety-eight,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>July the second, fifteen ninety-four.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">We should do well, sir, with a slab like that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouldn't we?" And the sexton leered at Lodge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Not many boasts a finer slab than that.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's many a king done worse. Ah, well, you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd a fine record. Living to ninety-eight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He buried generations of the poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A countless host, and thought no more of it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than digging potatoes. He'd a lofty mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That found no satisfaction in small deeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from his burying of two queens he drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lively pleasure. Could he have buried a third,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would indeed have crowned his old white hairs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he was famous, and he thought, perchance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A third were mere vain-glory. So he died.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I helped him with the second."<br /></span>
<span class="i30">The old man leered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the shaft go home.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Ben filled the stoup<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ale. "So that," quoth he, "began the tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About this ruby ring?" "But who," said Lodge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Who was the second queen?"<br /></span>
<span class="i28">"A famous queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a great lover! When you hear her name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your hearts will leap. Her beauty passed the bounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of modesty, men say, yet&mdash;she died young!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We buried her at midnight. There were few<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That knew it; for the high State Funeral<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was held upon the morrow, Lammas morn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anon you shall hear why. A strange thing that,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the mourners weeping round a hearse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That held a dummy coffin. Stranger still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see us lowering the true coffin down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By torchlight, with some few of her true friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Peterborough Cathedral, all alone."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Old as the world," said Ford. "It is the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of princes. Their true tears and smiles are seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At dead of night, like ghosts raised from the grave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the luxury of their brief, bright noon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cloaks but a dummy throne, a mask of life;</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, at the last, drapes a false catafalque,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding a vacant urn, a mask of death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tell, tell on!"<br /></span>
<span class="i20">The sexton took a draught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ale and smacked his lips.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">"Mine uncle lived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mile or more from Peterborough, then.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, past his cottage, in the dead of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her royal coach came creeping through the lanes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scutcheons round it and no crowd to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heralds carrying torches in their hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none to admire, but him and me, and one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pedlar-poet, who lodged with us that week<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And paid his lodging with a bunch of rhymes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By these, he said, my uncle Robert's fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should live, as in a picture, till the crack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of doom. My uncle thought that he should pay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four-pence beside; but, when the man declared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thought unworthy of these august events,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My uncle was abashed.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">And, truth to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rhymes were mellow, though here and there he swerved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From truth to make them so. Nor would he change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'June' to 'July' for all that we could say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I never said the month was June,' he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'And if I did, Shakespeare hath jumped an age!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gods, will you hedge me round with thirty nights?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"June" rhymes with "moon"!' With that, he flung them down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strode away like Lucifer, and was gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before old Scarlet could approach again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The matter of that four-pence.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Yet his rhymes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have caught the very colours of that night!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can see through them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay, just as through our cottage window-panes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can see the great black coach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carrying the dead queen past our garden-gate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roses bobbing and fluttering to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hide, and yet show the more by hiding, half.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like smoked glass through which you see the sun,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song shows truest when it blurs the truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the way it goes."<br /></span>
<span class="i26">He rose to his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Picked up his spade, and struck an attitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaning upon it. "I've got to feel my spade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or I'll forget it. This is the way I speak it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always." And, with a schoolboy's rigid face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eyes fixed on the rafters, he began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing-song, the pedlar-poet's bunch of rhymes:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As I went by the cattle-shed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The grey dew dimmed the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, under a twisted apple-tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Robin Scarlet stood by me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Keep watch! Keep watch to-night," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"There's things 'ull come to pass.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Keep watch until the moon has cleared<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The thatch of yonder rick;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I'll come out of my cottage-door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wait for the coach of a queen once more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;you'll say nothing of what you've heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But rise and follow me quick."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And what 'ull I see if I keep your trust,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They stood, in the huge gloom of those old aisles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heralds with their torches, but their light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struggled in vain with that tremendous dark.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their ring of smoky red could only show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A few sad faces round the purple pall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wings of a stone angel overhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The base of three great pillars, and, fitfully,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That still was built of silence, like the drip<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The torches vanished. O, I was glad to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moonlight on the kind turf-mounds again.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, as I turned the key, a quivering hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was laid upon my arm. I turned and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That foreigner with the olive-coloured face.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From head to foot he shivered, as with cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He drew me into the shadows of the porch.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Come back with me,' he whispered, and slid his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Like ice it was!&mdash;along my wrist, and slipped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ring upon my finger, muttering quick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in a burning fever, 'All the wealth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Will know. Come back! One moment, only one!'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I thought the man was mad, and plucked my hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away from him. He caught me by the sleeve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sank upon his knees, lifting his face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most piteously to mine. 'One moment! See!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I loved her!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the moonlight glisten on his tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great, long, slow tears they were; and then&mdash;my God&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As his face lifted and his head sank back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beseeching me&mdash;I saw a crimson thread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Circling his throat, as though the headsman's axe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had cloven it with one blow, so shrewd, so keen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The head had slipped not from the trunk.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">I gasped;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The wound, O like a second awful mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wound began to gape.<br /></span>
<span class="i24">I tore my cloak<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I left them where they lay, and with a shout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dashed into the broad white empty road.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no soul in sight. Sweating with fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hastened home, not daring to look back;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All the Chief Mourners on dark thrones were set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within it, as jewels in some huge carcanet:<br /></span>
<span class="i18">Above was this device<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">In my defence, God me defend</span>, inscrolled<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sexton paused anew. All looked at him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at his wrinkled, grim, earth-coloured hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if, in that dim light, beclouded now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blue tobacco-smoke, they thought to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smouldering ruby again.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">"Ye know," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How master William Wickham preached that day?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ford nodded. "I have heard of it. He showed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subtly, O very subtly, after his kind,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the white Body of Beauty such as hers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was in itself Papistical, a feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fast, an incense, a burnt-offering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And an Abomination in the sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all true Protestants. Why, her very name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was Mary!"<br /></span>
<span class="i10">"Ay, that's true, that's very true!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sexton mused. "Now that's a strange deep thought!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bishop missed a text in missing that.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her name, indeed, was Mary!"<br /></span>
<span class="i28">"Did you find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your keys again?" "Ay, Sir, I found them!" "Where?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Strange you should ask me that! After the throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Departed, and the Nobles were at feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in the Bishop's Palace&mdash;a great feast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And worthy of their sorrow&mdash;I came back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carrying my uncle's second bunch of keys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lock the doors and search, too, for mine own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas growing dusk already, and as I thrust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The key into the lock, the great grey porch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew cold upon me, like a tomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">I pushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard at the key&mdash;then stopped&mdash;with all my flesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freezing, and half in mind to fly; for, sirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door was locked already, and&mdash;<i>from within</i>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I drew the key forth quietly and stepped back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the Churchyard, where the graves were warm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sunset still, and the blunt carven stones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lengthened their homely shadows, out and out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Everlasting. Then I plucked up heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing the footprints of that mighty Masque<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the pebbled path. A queer thought came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into my head that all the world without<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was but a Masque, and I was creeping back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back from the Mourner's Feast to Truth again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet&mdash;I grew bold, and tried the Southern door.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas locked, but held no key on the inner side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To foil my own, and softly, softly, click,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turned it, and with heart, sirs, in my mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pushed back the studded door and entered in ...<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stepped straight out of the world, I might have said,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the dusk into a night so deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So dark, I trembled like a child....<br /></span>
<span class="i36">And then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was aware, sirs, of a great sweet wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of incense. All the gloom was heavy with it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if her Papist Household had returned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pray for her poor soul; and, my fear went.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But either that strange incense weighed me down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else from being sorely over-tasked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A languor came upon me, and sitting there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To breathe a moment, in a velvet stall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I closed mine eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i20">A moment, and no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For then I heard a rustling in the nave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And opened them; and, very far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if across the world, in Rome herself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw twelve tapers in the solemn East,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw, or thought I saw, cowled figures kneel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before them, in an incense-cloud.<br /></span>
<span class="i34">And then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maybe the sunset deepened in the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of masques without&mdash;clear proof that I had closed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine eyes but for a moment, sirs, I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if across a world-without-end tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tiny jewelled glow of crimson panes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkening and brightening with the West.<br /></span>
<span class="i40">And then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I saw something more&mdash;Queen Mary's vault,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;it was open!...<br /></span>
<span class="i20">Then, I heard a voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A strange deep broken voice, whispering love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In soft French words, that clasped and clung like hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then&mdash;two shadows passed against the West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two blurs of black against that crimson stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly, O very slowly, with bowed heads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaning together, and vanished into the dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the Catafalque.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Then&mdash;I heard him pray,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knew him for the man that prayed to me,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray as a man prays for his love's last breath!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, O sirs, it caught me by the throat,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, too, dropped upon my knees and prayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, as in answer to his prayer, there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moan of music, a mighty shuddering sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the great organ, a sound that rose and fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like seas in anger, very far away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then a peal of thunder, and then it seemed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the graves were giving up their dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A great cowled host of shadows rose and sang;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I heard her sad, sad, little, broken voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out in the darkness. 'Ay, and David, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His blood is on the floors of Holyrood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speak for me.' Then that great ocean-sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swelled to a thunder again, and heaven and earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrivelled away; and in that huge slow hymn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chariots were driven forth in flaming rows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And terrible trumpets blown from deep to deep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then, ah then, the heart of heaven was hushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;in the hush&mdash;it seemed an angel wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another Mary wept, and gathering up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All our poor wounded, weary, way-worn world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as a Mother gathers up her babe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soothed it against her breast, and rained her tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the pierced feet of God, and melted Him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pity, and over His feet poured her deep hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The music died away. The shadows knelt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then&mdash;I heard a rustling nigh the tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard&mdash;and heard&mdash;or dreamed I heard&mdash;farewells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewells for everlasting, deep farewells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bitter as blood, darker than any death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, at the last, as in a kiss, one breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One agony of sweetness, like a sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sharpness, drawn along a soft white throat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, for its terrible sweetness, like a sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across great waters, very far away,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sweetheart!</i></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And then, like doors, like world-without-end doors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shut for Everlasting, came a clang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ringing, echoing, through the echo of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One terrible cry that plucked my heart-strings out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Mary!</i> And on the closed and silent tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where there were two, one shuddering shadow lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then&mdash;I, too,&mdash;reeled, swooned and knew no more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sirs, when I woke, there was a broad bright shaft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of moonlight, slanting through an Eastern pane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full on her tomb and that black Catafalque.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the tomb there lay&mdash;my bunch of keys!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I struggled to my feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ashamed of my wild fancies, like a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awakening from a drunken dream. And yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I picked up the keys, although that storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of terror had all blown by and left me calm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lifted up mine eyes to see the scroll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the rich crest of that dark canopy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">In my defence, God me defend</span>. The moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck full upon it; and, as I turned and went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God help me, sirs, though I were loyal enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To good Queen Bess, I could not help but say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Amen!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet, methought it was not I that spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But some deep soul that used me for a mask,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A soul that rose up in this hollow shell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like dark sea-tides flooding an empty cave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not help but say with my poor lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Amen! Amen!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i18">Sirs, 'tis a terrible thing<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Well, sirs, that dark tide rose within my brain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I snatched his keys and flung them over the hedge,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And wept and wept and wept.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">It puzzled him.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In Peterborough Churchyard. So I came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To London&mdash;to St. Mary Magdalen's.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here in the Mermaid Inn. 'Twas All Souls' Eve,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Was master Shakespeare&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, the lights burned low,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And lit it for me.<br /></span>
<span class="i18">Peach, the astrologer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was living then; and that same night I went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told him all my trouble about this ring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took my hand in his, and held it&mdash;thus&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Peach was a rogue, some say, and yet he spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most truly about the first," the sexton mused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For master Shakespeare, though they say in youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outside the theatres, he would hold your horse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pence, prospered at last, bought a fine house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Stratford, lived there like a squire, they say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here, here he would sit, for all the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he were but a poet! God bless us all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then&mdash;to think!&mdash;he rose to be a squire!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deep one, masters! Well, he lit my pipe!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why did they bury such a queen by night?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Ford. "Kings might have wept for her. Did Death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Play epicure and glutton that so few<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were bidden to such a feast. Once on a time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could have wept, myself, to hear a tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beauty buried in the dark. And hers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was loveliness, far, far beyond the common!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such beauty should be marble to the touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of time, and clad in purple to amaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moth. But she was kind and soft and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman, and so she died. But, why the dark?"</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Nay! Gentlemen to bear! But&mdash;the true cause&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, sir, 'tis unbelievable, even to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sexton, for a queen so fair of face!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all her beds, even as the pedlar said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathing Arabia, sirs, her walls all hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With woven purple wonders and great tales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of amorous gods, and mighty mirrors, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imaging her own softness, night and dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When through her sumptuous hair she drew the combs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like one great white rose-leaf half her breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone through it, firm as ivory."<br /></span>
<span class="i34">"Ay," said Lodge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmuring his own rich music under breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>About her neck did all the graces throng,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And lay such baits as did entangle death.</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well, sir, the weather being hot, they feared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would not hold the burying!"...<br /></span>
<span class="i36">"In some sort,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ford answered slowly, "if your tale be true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She did not hold it. Many a knightly crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will bend yet o'er the ghost of that small hand."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was a hush, broken by Ben at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who turned to Ford&mdash;"How now, my golden lad?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The astrologer's dead hand is on thy purse!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ford laughed, grimly, and flung an angel down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well, cause or consequence, rhyme or no rhyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is thy gold. I will not break the spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or thou mayst live to bury us one and all!"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"And, if I live so long," the old man replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lighting his lanthorn, "you may trust me, sirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine Inn is quiet, and I can find you beds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Queens might sleep all night and never move.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good-night, sirs, and God bless you, one and all."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He shouldered pick and spade. I opened the door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The snow blew in, and, as he shuffled out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, in the strait dark passage, I could swear</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw a spark of red upon his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a great smouldering ruby.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">I gasped. He stopped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He peered at me.<br /></span>
<span class="i16">"Twice in a night," he said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nothing," I answered, "only the lanthorn-light."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shook his head. "I'll tell you something more!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's nothing, nothing now in life or death<br /></span>

<span class="i30">I watched him go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With glimmering lanthorn up the narrow street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one that walked upon the clouds, through snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seemed to mix the City with the skies.<br /></span>

<h4>FLOS MERCATORUM</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Flos Mercatorum!</span> On that night of nights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We drew from out our Mermaid cellarage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the old glory of London in one cask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of magic vintage. Never a city on earth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rome, Paris, Florence, Bagdad&mdash;held for Ben<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The colours of old London; and, that night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We staved them like a wine, and drank, drank deep!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas Master Heywood, whom the Mermaid Inn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had dubbed our London laureate, hauled the cask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of its ancient harbourage. "Ben," he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bustling into the room with Dekker and Brome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The prentices are up!" Ben raised his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the chimney-corner where he drowsed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And listened, reaching slowly for his pipe.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Clerk of the Bow Bell</i>," all along the Cheape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came a shout that swelled into a roar.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"What! Will they storm the Mermaid?" Heywood laughed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"They are turning into Bread Street!"<br /></span>
<span class="i38">Down they came!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We heard them hooting round the poor old Clerk&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Clubs! Clubs! The rogue would have us work all night!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rang ten minutes late! Fifteen, by Paul's!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over the hubbub rose, like a thin bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Clerk's entreaty&mdash;"Now, good boys, good boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Children of Cheape, be still, I do beseech you!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I took some forty winks, but then...." A roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wrathful laughter drowned him&mdash;"Forty winks!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember Black May-day! We'll make you wink!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a scuffle, and into the tavern rushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gregory Clopton, Clerk of the Bow Bell,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tall thin man, with yellow hair a-stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blazing eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i18">"Hide me," he clamoured, "quick!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These picaroons will murder me!"<br /></span>
<span class="i32">I closed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thick oak doors against the coloured storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of prentices in red and green and ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saffron and Reading tawny. Twenty clubs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drubbed on the panels as I barred them out;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even our walls and shutters could not drown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their song that, like a mocking peal of bells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under our windows, made all Bread Street ring:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"<i>Clerk of the Bow Bell,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i14"><i>With the yellow locks,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i12"><i>For thy late ringing</i><br /></span>
<span class="i14"><i>Thy head shall have knocks!</i>"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Heywood, seeing the Clerk was all a-quake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went to an upper casement that o'er-looked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole of Bread Street. Heywood knew their ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And parleyed with them till their anger turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shouts of merriment. Then, like one deep bell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice rang out, in answer to their peal:</span>&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"<i>Children of Cheape,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i14"><i>Rung at your will!</i>"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Loudly they cheered him. Courteously he bowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then firmly shut the window; and, ere I filled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cup with sack again, the crowd had gone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My clochard, sirs, is warm," quavered the Clerk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I do confess I took some forty winks!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are good lads, our prentices of Cheape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hasty!"<br /></span>
<span class="i12">"Wine!" said Ben. He filled a cup<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrust it into Gregory's trembling hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yours is a task," said Dekker, "a great task!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You sit among the gods, a lord of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Measuring out the pulse of London's heart."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Yea, sir, above the hours and days and years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sometimes think. 'Tis a great Bell&mdash;the Bow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hath been, since the days of Whittington."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"The good old days," growled Ben. "Both good and bad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were measured by my Bell," the Clerk replied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while he spoke, warmed by the wine, his voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mellowed and floated up and down the scale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the music of the London bells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lingered upon his tongue. "I know them all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love them, all the voices of the bells.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Flos Mercatorum!</span> That's the Bell of Bow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembering Richard Whittington. You should hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bells of London when they tell his tale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once, after hearing them, I wrote it down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know the tale by heart now, every turn."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Then ring it out," said Heywood.<br /></span>
<span class="i36">Gregory smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cleared his throat.<br /></span>
<span class="i24">"You must imagine, sirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Clerk, sitting on high, among the clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With London spread beneath him like a map.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">But bells no less, ask that the Bell of Bow<br /></span>

<span class="i10">Then Gregory Clopton, mellowing all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chiming vowels, and dwelling on every tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In rhythm or rhyme that helped to swell the peal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or keep the ringing measure, beat for beat,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Clerk of the Bow Bell, four and twenty prentices,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Younger son, younger son, up with stick and bundle!"&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Every barefoot boy on earth is but a younger son."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Proudly he answered us, beneath the painted window,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Though I be a younger son, the glory falls to me:<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Down along the Mendip dale, the chapmen and their horses,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Crimson kegs of malmsey, and the silks of London town.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the chapmen asked of him the bridle-path to Dorset,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Then&mdash;by little Kimmeridge&mdash;they led him turn for turn.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">All the way to London, with packs of wool they went.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"London was London, then! A clean, clear moat<br /></span>

<span class="i12">"Call it a silver moat," growled Ben,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That's the new poetry! Call it crystal, lad!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, till you kiss the Beast, you'll never find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Fairy Prince. Why, all those crowded streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flung all their filth, their refuse, rags and bones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead cats and dogs, into your clean clear moat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made it sluggish as old Acheron.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fevers and plagues, death in a thousand shapes<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Drums rolled, earth shook, and shattering trumpets pealed.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">This was well seen of Richard Whittington;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For only he that finds the London streets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paved with red flints, at last shall find them paved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to the Perfect City, with pure gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye know the world! what was a London waif<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Hugh Fitzwarren's daughter? He was fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And harboured; and the cook declared she lacked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A scullion. So, in Hugh Fitzwarren's house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turned the jack, and scoured the dripping-pan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How could he hope for more?<br /></span>
<span class="i28">This marchaunt's house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was builded like a great high-gabled inn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Square, with a galleried courtyard, such as now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The players use. Its rooms were rich and dim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With deep-set coloured panes and massy beams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its ancient eaves jutted o'er <i>Red Rose Lane</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkly, like eyebrows of a mage asleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its oaken stair coiled upward through a dusk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy with fume of scented woods that burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep the Plague away,&mdash;a gloom to embalm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Pharaoh, but to dull the cheek and eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of country lads like Whittington.<br /></span>
<span class="i34">He pined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wind and sunlight. Yet he plied his task<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patient as in old tales of Elfin-land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young knight would unhelm his golden locks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And play the scullion, so that he might watch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lady's eyes unknown, and oftener hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her brook-like laughter rippling overhead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her green gown, like the breath of Eden boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rustling nigh him. And all day long he found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sunshine enough in this. But when at night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He crept into the low dark vaulted den,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cobwebbed cellar, where the cook had strewn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scullion's bed of straw (and none too thick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest he should sleep too long), he choked for breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like an old man hoarding up his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fostered his glimmering rushlight as he sate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bolt upright, while a horrible scurry heaved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rustling bed, and bright black-beaded eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peered at him from the crannies of the wall.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then darkness whelmed him, and perchance he slept,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only to fight with nightmares and to fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down endless tunnels in a ghastly dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunted by horrible human souls that took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shape of monstrous rats, great chattering snouts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vile shapes of shadowy cunning and grey greed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gnaw through beams, and undermine tall towns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carry the seeds of plague and ruin and death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the careless homes of sleeping men.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus, in the darkness, did he wage a war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the powers of darkness. 'If the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do break upon me, by the grace of God,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So did he vow, 'O, then will I remember,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, then, will I remember, ay, and help<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To build that lovelier City which is paved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For rich and poor alike, with purest gold.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, sirs, he kept his vow. Ye will not smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, at the first, the best that he could do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was with his first poor penny-piece to buy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cat, and bring her home, under his coat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By stealth (or else that termagant, the cook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had drowned it in the water-butt, nor deemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water worse to drink). So did he quell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First his own plague, but bettered others, too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, in those days, Marchaunt Adventurers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shared with their prentices the happy chance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of each new venture. Each might have his stake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little or great, upon the glowing tides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of high romance that washed the wharfs of Thames;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every lad in London had his groat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or splendid shilling on some fair ship at sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, on an April eve, Fitzwarren called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His prentices together; for, ere long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>Unicorn</i>, his tall new ship, must sail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the world to gather gorgeous webs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Eastern looms, great miracles of silk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dipt in the dawn by wizard hands of Ind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if they chanced upon that fabled coast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Sydon, river of jewels, like a snake</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slides down the gorge its coils of crimson fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance a richer cargo,&mdash;rubies, pearls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or gold bars from the Gates of Paradise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a moon, at least, a fa&euml;rie foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would lap Blackfriars wharf, where London lads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazed in the sunset down that misty reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For old black battered hulks and tattered sails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bringing their dreams home from the uncharted sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And one flung down a groat&mdash;he had no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One staked a shilling, one a good French crown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one an angel, O, light-winged enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reach Cathay; and not a lad but bought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pennyworth of wonder,<br /></span>
<span class="i26">So they thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till all at once Fitzwarren's daughter cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Father, you have forgot poor Whittington!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Snails,' laughed the rosy marchaunt, 'but that's true!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fetch Whittington! The lad must stake his groat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twill bring us luck!'<br /></span>
<span class="i22">'Whittington! Whittington!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the dark stair, like a gold-headed bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fluttered sweet Alice. 'Whittington! Richard! Quick!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick with your groat now for the <i>Unicorn</i>!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A groat!' cried Whittington, standing there aghast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With brown bare arms, still coloured by the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among his pots and pans. 'Where should I find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A groat? I staked my last groat in a cat!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;'What! Have you nothing? Nothing but a cat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stake the cat,' she said; and the quick fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in a woman's mind out-runs the thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of man, lit her grey eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Whittington laughed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And opened the cellar-door. Out sailed his wealth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waving its tail, purring, and rubbing its head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now on his boots, now on the dainty shoe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Alice, who straightway, deaf to his laughing prayers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught up the cat, whispered it, hugged it close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against its grey fur leaned her glowing cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carried it off in triumph.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28"><i>Red Rose Lane</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echoed with laughter as, with amber eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blinking, the grey cat in a seaman's arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went to the wharf. 'Ay, but we need a cat,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The captain said. So, when the painted ship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sailed through a golden sunrise down the Thames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grey tail waved upon the misty poop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Whittington had his venture on the seas.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was a nine days' jest, and soon forgot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, all that year,&mdash;ah, sirs, ye know the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the foolish boasting of the proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks not beneath the coat of Taunton serge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Gules and Azure. A prince that comes in rags<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To clean your shoes and, out of his own pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waits for the world to paint his shield again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must wait for ever and a day.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">The world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a great hypocrite, hypocrite most of all<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Tramples the scullion's heraldry underfoot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, never sees it, never dreams of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Content to know that, here and now, his coat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is greasy....<br /></span>
<span class="i14">So did Whittington find at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such nearness was most distant; that to see her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talk with her, serve her thus, was but to lose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True sight, true hearing.   He must save his life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By losing it; forsake, to win, his love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go out into the world to bring her home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was but labour lost to clean the shoes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn the jack, and scour the dripping-pan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For every scolding blown about her ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cook's great ladle fell upon the head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Whittington; who, beneath her rule, became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scullery's general scapegoat.    It was he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That burned the pie-crust, drank the hippocras,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dinted the silver beaker....<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Many a month<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He chafed, till his resolve took sudden shape</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, out of the dark house at the peep of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouldering bundle and stick again, he stole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek his freedom, and to shake the dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of London from his shoes....<br /></span>
<span class="i28">You know the stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Highgate, where he sate awhile to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With aching heart, and thought 'I shall not see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her face again.' There, as the coloured dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the sleeping City slowly bloomed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A small black battered ship with tattered sails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blurring the burnished glamour of the Thames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crept, side-long to a wharf.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Then, all at once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The London bells rang out a welcome home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, over them all, tossing the tenor on high,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stood in the glory of the coloured panes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thrust the splendid load into her arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muttering&mdash;'Take it, lady! Let me be poor!<br /></span>

<h4>RALEIGH</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ben was our only guest that day. His tribe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had flown to their new shrine&mdash;the Apollo Room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which, though they enscrolled his golden verse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above their doors like some great-fruited vine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ben still preferred our <i>Mermaid</i>, and to smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone in his old nook; perhaps to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voices of the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voices of his old companions.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hovering near him,&mdash;Will and Kit and Rob.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Our Ocean-shepherd from the Main-deep sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raleigh," he muttered, as I brimmed his cup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Last of the men that broke the fleets of Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas not enough to cage him, sixteen years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rotting his heart out in the Bloody Tower,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they must fling him forth in his old age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hunt for El Dorado. Then, mine host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because his poor old ship <i>The Destiny</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smashes the Spaniard, but comes tottering home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without the Spanish gold, our gracious king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please a catamite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sends the old lion back to the Tower again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The friends of Spain will send him to the block<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This time. That male Salome, Buckingham,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is dancing for his head. Raleigh is doomed."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shadow stood in the doorway. We looked up;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, but O, how changed, how worn and grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Walter Raleigh, like a hunted thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stared at us.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"Ben," he said, and glanced behind him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ben took a step towards him.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">"O, my God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ben," whispered the old man in a husky voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half timorous and half cunning, so unlike<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His old heroic self that one might weep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear it, "Ben, I have given them all the slip!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I may be followed. Can you hide me here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till it grows dark?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ben drew him quickly in, and motioned me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lock the door. "Till it grows dark," he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My God, that you should ask it!"<br /></span>
<span class="i38">"Do not think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not believe that I am quite disgraced,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man faltered, "for they'll say it, Ben;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when my boy grows up, they'll tell him, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father was a coward. I do cling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To life for many reasons, not from fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of death. No, Ben, I can disdain that still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But&mdash;there's my boy!"<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Then all his face went blind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dropt upon Ben's shoulder and sobbed outright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"They are trying to break my pride, to break my pride!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The window darkened, and I saw a face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blurring the panes. Ben gripped the old man's arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And led him gently to a room within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the way of guests.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i20">"Your pride," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That is the pride of England!"<br /></span>
<span class="i32">At that name&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>England!</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As at a signal-gun, heard in the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far out at sea, the weather and world-worn man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That once was Raleigh, lifted up his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old age and weakness, weariness and fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell from him like a cloak. He stood erect.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eager eyes, full of great sea-washed dawns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burned for a moment with immortal youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While tears blurred mine to see him.<br /></span>
<span class="i36">"You do think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That England will remember? You do think it?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He asked with a great light upon his face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ben bowed his head in silence.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">"I have wronged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My cause by this," said Raleigh. "Well they know it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who left this way for me. I have flung myself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a blind moth into this deadly light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of freedom. Now, at the eleventh hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it too late? I might return and&mdash;"<br /></span>
<span class="i38">"No!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not now!" Ben interrupted. "I'd have said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laugh at the headsman sixteen years ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When England was awake. She will awake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again. But now, while our most gracious king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hates tobacco, dedicates his prayers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Buckingham&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is no land for men that, under God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shattered the Fleet Invincible."<br /></span>
<span class="i32">A knock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Startled us, at the outer door. "My friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stukeley," said Raleigh, "if I know his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has a ketch will carry me to France,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting at Tilbury."<br /></span>
<span class="i20">I let him in,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lean and stealthy fellow, Sir Lewis Stukeley,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">liked him little. He thought much of his health,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">More of his money bags, and most of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On how to run with all men all at once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his own profit. At the <i>Mermaid Inn</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men disagreed in friendship and in truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he agreed with all men, and his life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was one soft quag of falsehood. Fugitives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must use false keys, I thought; and there was hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Raleigh if such a man would walk one mile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To serve him now. Yet my throat moved to see him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Usurping, with one hand on Raleigh's arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kind of ownership. "<i>Lend me ten pounds</i>,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were the first words he breathed in the old man's ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Raleigh slipped his purse into his hand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just over Bread Street hung the bruised white moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they crept out. Sir Lewis Stukeley's watch-dog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A derelict bo'sun, with a mulberry face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Met them outside. "The coast quite clear, eh, Hart?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Stukeley. "Ah, that's good. Lead on, then, quick."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, framed in the cruddle of moonlit clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ended the steep street, dark on its light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And standing on those glistening cobblestones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just where they turned to silver, Raleigh looked back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before he turned the corner. He stood there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A figure like foot-feathered Mercury,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tall, straight and splendid, waving his plumed hat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Ben, and taking his last look, I felt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon our <i>Mermaid Tavern</i>. As he paused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His long fantastic shadow swayed and swept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against our feet. Then, like a shadow, he passed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It is not right," said Ben, "it is not right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why did they give the old man so much grace?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Witness and evidence are what they lack.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would you trust Stukeley&mdash;not to draw him out?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raleigh was always rash. A phrase or two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will turn their murderous axe into a sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of righteousness&mdash;</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">Why, come to think of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blackfriar's Wharf, last night, I landed there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;no, by God!&mdash;Raleigh is not himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tide will never serve beyond Gravesend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is a trap! Come on! We'll follow them!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick! To the river side!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i26">We reached the wharf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only to see their wherry, a small black cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwindling far down that running silver road.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ben touched my arm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Look there," he said, pointing up-stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i38">The moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glanced on a cluster of pikes, like silver thorns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three hundred yards away, a little troop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of weaponed men, embarking hurriedly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their great black wherry clumsily swung about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, with twelve oars for legs, came striding down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An armoured beetle on the glittering trail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some small victim.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Just below our wharf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little dinghy waddled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ben cut the painter, and without one word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew her up crackling thro' the lapping water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Motioned me to the tiller, thrust her off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, pulling with one oar, backing with the other,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swirled her round and down, hard on the track<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Raleigh. Ben was an old man now but tough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O tough as a buccaneer. We distanced them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His oar blades drove the silver boiling back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Broken Wharf the beetle was a speck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It dwindled by Queen Hythe and the Three Cranes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Bellyn's Gate we had left it, out of sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Custom House and Galley Keye we shot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro' silver all the way, without one glimpse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Raleigh. Then a dreadful shadow fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over us the Tower of London rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like ebony; and, on the glittering reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond it, I could see the small black cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That carried the great old seaman slowly down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the dark shores whence in happier years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The throng had cheered his golden galleons out,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watched his proud sails filling for Cathay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, as through lead, we dragged by Traitor's Gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, in the darkness, under the Bloody Tower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, on the very verge of victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ben gasped and dropped his oars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Take one and row," he said, "my arms are numbed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll overtake him yet!" I clambered past him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took the bow oar.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">Once, as the pace flagged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over his shoulder he turned his great scarred face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And snarled, with a trickle of blood on his coarse lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hard!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blood and fire ran through my veins again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For half a minute more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">Yet we fell back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our course was crooked now. And suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grim black speck began to grow behind us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grow like the threat of death upon old age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, thickening, blackening, sharpening, foaming, swept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up the bright line of bubbles in our wake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That armoured wherry, with its long twelve oars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All well together now.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">"Too late," gasped Ben,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ash-grey face uplifted to the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One quivering hand upon the thwart behind him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment. Then he bowed over his knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coughing. "But we'll delay them. We'll be drunk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hold the catch-polls up!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">We drifted down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before them, broadside on. They sheered aside.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, feigning a clumsy stroke, Ben drove our craft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they drew level, right in among their blades.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a shout, an oath. They thrust us off;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then we swung our nose against their bows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pulled them round with every well-meant stroke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A full half minute, ere they won quite free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cursing us for a pair of drunken fools.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We drifted down behind them.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">"There's no doubt,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Ben, "the headsman waits behind all this</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Raleigh. This is a play to cheat the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of England, teach the people to applaud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The red fifth act."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without another word we drifted down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For centuries it seemed, until we came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Greenwich.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then up the long white burnished reach there crept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like little sooty clouds the two black boats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet us.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"He is in the trap," said Ben,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And does not know it yet. See, where he sits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Stukeley as by a friend."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">Long after this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We heard how Raleigh, simply as a child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing the tide would never serve him now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they must turn, had taken from his neck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some trinkets that he wore. "Keep them," he said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Stukeley, "in remembrance of this night."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He had no doubts of Stukeley when he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wherry close beside them. He but wrapped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cloak a little closer round his face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our boat rocked in their wash when Stukeley dropped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mask. We saw him give the sign, and heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His high-pitched quavering voice&mdash;"<span class="smcap">in the king's name!</span>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raleigh rose to his feet. "I am under arrest?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, like a dazed man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">And Stukeley laughed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as he bore himself to the grim end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All doubt being over, the old sea-king stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among those glittering points, a king indeed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The black boats rocked. We heard his level voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Sir Lewis, these actions never will turn out</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To your good credit.</i>" Across the moonlit Thames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It rang contemptuously, cold as cold steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passionless as the judgment that ends all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some three months later, Raleigh's widow came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lodge a se'nnight at the Mermaid Inn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His house in Bread Street was no more her own,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the hands of Stukeley, who had reaped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pretty harvest ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She kept close to her room, and that same night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being ill and with some fever, sent her maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fetch the apothecary from Friday Street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old "Galen" as the Mermaid christened him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At that same moment, as the maid went out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stukeley came in. He met her at the door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, chucking her under the chin, gave her a letter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Take this up to your mistress. It concerns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her property," he said. "Say that I wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would be glad to speak with her."<br /></span>
<span class="i34">The wench<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked pertly in his face, and tripped upstairs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I scarce could trust my hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">"Sir Lewis," I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This is no time to trouble her. She is ill."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Let her decide," he answered, with a sneer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before I found another word to say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maid tripped down again. I scarce believed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My senses, when she beckoned him up the stair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaking from head to foot, I blocked the way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Property!" Could the crux of mine and thine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring widow and murderer into one small room?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sir Lewis," I said, "she is ill. It is not right!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She never would consent."<br /></span>
<span class="i28">He sneered again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You are her doctor? Out of the way, old fool!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She has decided!"<br /></span>
<span class="i20">"Go," I said to the maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Fetch the apothecary. Let it rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him!"<br /></span>
<span class="i10">She tossed her head. Her quick eyes glanced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showing the white, like the eyes of a vicious mare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She laughed at Stukeley, loitered, then obeyed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so we waited, till the wench returned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Galen at her heels. His wholesome face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Russet and wrinkled like an apple, peered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrewdly at Stukeley, twinkled once at me,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passed in silence, leaving a whiff of herbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind him on the stair.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Five minutes later,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my amazement, that same wholesome face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaned from the lighted door above, and called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sir Lewis Stukeley!"<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Sir Judas hastened up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The apothecary followed him within.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door shut. I was left there in the dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bewildered; for my heart was hot with thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those last months. Our Summer's Nightingale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Ocean-Shepherd from the Main-deep Sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Founder of our Mermaid Fellowship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was this his guerdon&mdash;at the Mermaid Inn?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was this that maid-of-honour whose romance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Raleigh, once, had been a kingdom's talk?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could Bess Throckmorton slight his memory thus?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It is not right," I said, "it is not right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wrongs him deeply."<br /></span>
<span class="i26">I leaned against the porch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Staring into the night. A ghostly ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above me, from her window, bridged the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rested on the goldsmith's painted sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opposite.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">I could hear the muffled voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Stukeley overhead, persuasive, bland;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, her own, cooing, soft as a dove<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It was the last night of another year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before I understood what punishment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had overtaken Stukeley. Ben, and Brome&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ben's ancient servant, but turned poet now&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i24">The starry night<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That our poor earth no longer was the hub<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those white wheeling orbs? I scarce believed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strange new dreams; but I had seen the veils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rent from vast oceans and huge continents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till what was once our comfortable fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our cosy tavern, and our earthly home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heaven beyond the next turn in the road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the resplendent fabric of our world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrank to a glow-worm, lighting up one leaf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one small forest, in one little land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among those wild infinitudes of God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tattered wastrel wandered down the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clad in a seaman's jersey, staring hard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At every sign. Beneath our own, the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell on his red carbuncled face. I knew him&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bo'sun, Hart.<br /></span>
<span class="i20">He pointed to our sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leered at me. "That's her," he said, "no doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea-witch with the shiny mackerel tail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swishing in wine. That's what Sir Lewis meant.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He called it blood. Blood is his craze, you see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the Mermaid Tavern, sir, no doubt?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I nodded. "Ah, I thought as much," he said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well&mdash;happen this is worth a cup of ale."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thrust his hand under his jersey and lugged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A greasy letter out. It was inscribed<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">The Apothecary at the Mermaid Tavern</span>.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">That sweet young naked wench curling her tail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those red waves.&mdash;The old man called it blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blood is his craze, you see.&mdash;But you can tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis wine, sir, by the foam. Malmsey, no doubt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that sweet wench to make you smack your lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like oysters, with her slippery tail and all!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, sir, no doubt, this was the Mermaid Inn."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But this," said Galen, lifting his grave face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Ben, "this letter is from all that's left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Stukeley. The good host, there, thinks I wronged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Ocean-shepherd's memory. From this letter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think I helped to avenge him. Do not wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His widow, even in thought. She loved him dearly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know she keeps his poor grey severed head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embalmed; and so will keep it till she dies;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In wild Italian tales. But <i>this</i> was true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had I refused to let her speak with Stukeley<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feared she would go mad. This letter proves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I&mdash;and she perhaps&mdash;were instruments,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some more terrible chirurgery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than either knew."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">"Ah, when I saw your sign,"<br /></span>

<span class="i2">"Go&mdash;paint your bows with hell-fire somewhere else,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And Hart lurched out into the night again,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"There are some men," said Galen,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Will heap up wrong on wrong; and, at the last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wonder because the world will not forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just when it suits them, cancel all they owe,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At their first cry. And, sirs, I do believe</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Stukeley, on that night, had some such wish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reconcile himself. What else had passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the widow and himself I know not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she had lured him on until he thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That words and smiles, perhaps a tear or two,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might make the widow take the murderer's hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In friendship, since it might advantage both.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed, he came prepared for even more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Villains are always fools. A wicked act,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is it but a false move in the game,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A blind man's blunder, a deaf man's reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wrong drug taken in the dead of night?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I always pity villains.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">I mistook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The avenger for the victim. There she lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Panting, that night, her eyes like summer stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her pale gold hair upon the pillows tossed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dishevelled, while the fever in her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought back the lost wild roses of her youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For half an hour. Against a breast as pure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smooth as any maid's, her soft arms pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bundle wrapped in a white embroidered cloth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She crooned over it as a mother croons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over her suckling child. I stood beside her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;That was her wish, and mine, while Stukeley stayed.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, over against me, on the other side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood Stukeley, gnawing his nether lip to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She could not, or she would not, speak one word<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To the hill-flowers clings my dust, and tho' eyeless Death may thrust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All else into the darkness, in their heaven I put my trust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a dawn shall bid me climb to the little spread of thyme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where first I heard the ripple of the fountain-heads of rhyme.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And a fir-wood that I know, from dawn to sunset-glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall whisper to a lonely sea, that swings far, far below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death, thy dawn makes all things new. Hills of Youth, I come to you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moving through the dew, moving through the dew.<br /></span>
